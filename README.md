# DORIS
The Dynamic Oriented Rehabilitative Integrated System

**Authors**: Susanna Summa, Riccardo Gori, Luigi Freda, Enrico Castelli and Maurizio Petrarca

This repository will provide part of the C++ implementation behind our paper titled **Development of a dynamic oriented rehabilitative integrated system (DORIS) and preliminary tests**, upon paper acceptance. 

Moving platforms are introduced in the field of the study of posturography since â€™70 years. Commercial platforms have some limits: 
* a limited number of Dofs; 
* pre-configured protocols 
* and usually they are expensive.   
In order to overcome these limits, we developed a robotic platform: DORIS. The adopted solution guarantees to be useful for both postural assessment and training of equilibrium and gait. The full control of its movement and of human dynamic interaction is a further benefit for the identification of innovative solutions for research and treatment in a field that is strongly investigated, but still open. DORIS is a Multi Intelligent System provided by the integration of specific modules.
